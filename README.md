#### [Healthlify](https://soumyajoydas01.github.io/healthlify.github.io/) is developed by [Soumyajoy!](https://soumyajoydas01.github.io/)

#### Healthlify is developed in the Hackathon Web-O-Code(BVEST 2021) conducted by Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering (BVCOE), New Delhi

#### The website is responsive and the entire front-end is developed using HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript

#### The website is focused on sharing blogs, currently the blogs are copied from some websites and I've given source for each blog to avoid plagiarism

#### The images are taken from unDraw and Adobe Sparks as they are free

#### Currently, the subscribe feature is just for show as it will require a backend support for storing data and automation for email

#### Healthlify, as of now, is totally focused on frontend and responsiveness
