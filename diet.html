            <h1>Importance of Healthy Diet</h1>
            <p>
                Eating a healthy diet is all about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and
                boosting your mood. Good nutrition, physical activity, and healthy body weight are essential parts of a
                person’s overall health and well-being.
                <br>
                <br>
                There’s no questioning the importance of healthy food in your life. Unless you maintain a proper diet
                for a healthy body, you may be prone to diseases, infection, or even exhaustion. The importance of
                nutritious food for children especially needs to be highlighted since otherwise they may end up being
                prone to several growth and developmental problems. Some of the most common health problems that arise
                from lack of a balanced diet are heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Being physically active manages many health problems and improves mental health by reducing stress,
                depression, and pain. Regular exercise helps to prevent metabolic syndrome, stroke, high blood pressure,
                arthritis, and anxiety.
