            <h1>Importance of Regular Exercise</h1>
            <p>
                A number of studies have found that exercise helps depression. There are many views as to how exercise
                helps people with depression:
                <br>
                <br>
                Exercise may block negative thoughts or distract you from daily worries.
                Exercising with others provides an opportunity for increased social contact.
                Increased fitness may lift your mood and improve your sleep patterns.
                Exercise may also change levels of chemicals in your brain, such as serotonin, endorphins and stress
                hormones.
                <br>
                <br>
                To maintain health and reduce your risk of health problems, health professionals and researchers recommend a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days.
                <br>
                <br>
                Increases in daily activity can come from small changes made throughout your day, such as walking or cycling instead of using the car, getting off a tram, train or bus a stop earlier and walking the rest of the way, or walking the children to school.
