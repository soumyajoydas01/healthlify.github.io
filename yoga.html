            <h1>Importance of Yoga</h1>
            <p>The essence of yoga is equanimity of mind.
                Equanimity is when your mind is undisturbed.
                Losing balance causes numerous problems.
                <br>
                <br>
                The purpose of Yoga is to bring our balance back and then to maintain it.
                When the body is balanced, the mind is balanced.
                <br>
                <br>
                When the body/mind is balanced, stress fades away,
                energy returns, and equanimity is established.
                <br>
                <br>
                Equanimity gives us the strength of calmness, level-headedness, and composure.
                <br>
                <br>
                The mind and emotions are like a liquid.
                To hold liquid we need a solid cup.
                Otherwise, our minds are distracted and our emotions run wild.
                <br>
                <br>
                We can create a healthy container for the mind and emotions through the body.
                Since it is easier to work with the body,
                we start with the yoga of the body instead of the yoga of the mind.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the easiest ways to balance the body
                is by putting it in all the different positions or asanas,
                making it more relaxed, freeing it from all the accumulated toxins.
                Doing so improves our health in remarkable ways and
                causes the mind to become more balanced and have more equanimity.</p>
